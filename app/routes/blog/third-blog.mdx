So I felt like I was lacking some skills when it comes to interactivity with React, I decided to build this quiz, to play more with states, and see how it goes. I learned a lot. But I still feel a little rusty in this topic, I guess I need to build more interactive things

## Walk-through

The quiz is available [here](https://quizgame-1xt4.vercel.app/)

As a fun fact I needed to set difficulty to easy, the questions were pretty hard lol
I was thinking of rebuilding this project, but don't really have time for this now. Maybe in future :)

The idea is simple, you start the quiz, you answer the questions (you have only one chance to guess it, after that the specific question is locked!!! To make it more spicy)
After taking the whole quiz, you will get automatically scrolled to the top, and the results will be displayed. Try it out!
