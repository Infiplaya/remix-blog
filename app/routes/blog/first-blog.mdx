I decided to do something more complex and an idea for an app that let's you pick up new recipes came up when I was hungry. The whole idea of this app is pretty simple: you click on the start button, and have to options:
Search by the dish you would like to see a recipe of, or if you can't decide, like me - just choose a random recipe. The app will display to you the image of the food, it's name, list of ingredients needed, and the instructions.

## Walk-through

Go to this page:

[click](https://grabafood.vercel.app/)

Scroll down, if you want to create account, make one, if not just click on the 'start as Guest'

You will get two options: search by the name, or get a random one. Decide!

If you choose option 1, the app will display to you recipes that match your query. Now just click on one of them that you like to get your recipe.
Congrats!

Option 2 looks similar, but you just get a random recipe faster.
