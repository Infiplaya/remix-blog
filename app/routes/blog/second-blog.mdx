After grasping the basics of React and learning about NextJS, I decided that I would create a personal page where I would post my description so that people could get to know me, and my own projects.

## Walk-through

If you want to see this website check it [out](https://psobaniec.vercel.app/projects)

This is the preview:

Main idea was to keep it simple. I did not used flashy things, because I feel like I did not need them.

Hovewer I did implement clickable dark/light mode, try it and choose which one do you prefer! I'm definitely the dark theme guy.

If you scroll down you will se a couple of picked by me projects. 

For almost all projects list that I've played with check out my github [here](https://github.com/infiplaya)
